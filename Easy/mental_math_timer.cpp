/*
Context: Youâ€™re building a mini-game for a brain training app. It presents users with simple random additions to solve under mental pressure. Your Task: Generate two random integers between 10 and 99. Display them and ask the user to type the result. Check if the answer is correct.
Bonus: Use ctime and cstdlib for randomness.
Goal: Practice random number generation, conditionals, and input/output.
